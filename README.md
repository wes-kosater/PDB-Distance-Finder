# PDB-Distance-Finder

This is a cool little script that I am using as a small component in my wider master's thesis research.

This script will take a PDB file as input, extracts all of the alpha carbon positions, reads the atomic coordinates, applies a Euclidean distance calculation, and outputs an all vs. all distance matrix in the form of a heatmap. 

Will upload code once I find time

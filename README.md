# PDB-Distance-Finder

This is a cool little script that I am using as a small component in my wider master's thesis research.

This script will take a PDB file as input, read the atomic coordinates, apply a Euclidean distance calculation,
and output an all vs. all distance matrix in the form of a heatmap. 

Will upload code once I find time
